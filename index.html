    <h1>Console</h1>
    <p>In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a
        combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to
        input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It can also refer to specialized
        computers only meant to play video games.

        A console is also known as a computer console, a system console or simply as a terminal.</p>
